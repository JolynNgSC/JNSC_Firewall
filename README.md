# Firewall
The following research was conducted in 2023, focusing on Firewall. 

## Understanding Firewall

Firewalls are designed to prevent unauthorized access to or from a private network while allowing authorized communications to pass. They achieve this by inspecting data packets and determining whether they should be allowed through based on a set of predefined rules. These rules can be configured to filter traffic based on various criteria, such as IP addresses, port numbers, protocols, and application types.

There are several types of firewalls, including:

**Packet-filtering firewalls:** These examine packets of data as they pass through the firewall and make decisions to allow or block them based on predefined rules.

**Stateful inspection firewalls:** These maintain a record of the state of active connections and make decisions based on the context of the traffic, which provides better security than packet-filtering firewalls.

**Proxy firewalls:** These act as intermediaries between internal and external systems, receiving and forwarding network requests on behalf of the client. They can inspect and filter both inbound and outbound traffic.

**Next-generation firewalls (NGFW):** These combine traditional firewall functionality with additional features such as intrusion prevention, application awareness, and advanced threat detection capabilities.
